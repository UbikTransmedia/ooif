#THIS CLASS CREATES AN OBJECT THAT CONTAINS ALL THE VERBS THE PLAYER CAN EXECUTE
	#This is a bit messed. Sometimes verbs work with duplicated information and different data types. There are still lots to do in here.

	#Actions to implement: open, close, crouch, stand up, drop, pull, push

	#Actions fo fix: examine, exits, look, use, take

	#Actions to expand: go to

class Action
