# OOIF! Object-Oriented Interactive Fiction (Parser), v. 0.1

1. I am a computer hobbyist.
2. I am learning Ruby.
3. This is a parser for text adventures I am working on.

Please, feel free to cooperate. Any help and hint will be very welcome. I will be available trough my email adress.

The tasks that must be done before implementing anyone else are described inside the files. It is necessary:
  - To implement all the verbs (actions.rb)
  - To clean the code of redundant information
  - To refactor some parts

Aditional modules (such as turn-oriented events) will come later, once we have a novel we can explore :)
