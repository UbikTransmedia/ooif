# OOIF! Object-Oriented Interactive Fiction (Parser), v. 0.1

1. I am a computer hobbyist.
2. I am learning Ruby.
3. This is a parser for text adventures I am working on.

Please, feel free to cooperate. Any help and hint will be very welcome. I will be available trough my email adress.

The nowadays version works like this:
  - game.rb initializes all the game objects and calls to the Game function.
  - The Game function initializes the first vectors of the game, creates the Player, an Actioner and the Command Input.
  - The Command Input takes the strings and converts them into data suitable for the Actioner (actions.rb).
  - the Actioner executes the verbs depending on the user input and modifies the game files (game.rb and instances defined in places.rb and objects.rb).

The tasks that must be done before implementing anyone else are described inside the files. It is necessary:
  - To implement all the verbs (actions.rb)
  - To clean the code of redundant information
  - To refactor some parts

Things that stay unclear:
  - A milestone system that keeps track of the player's progress ("Combined A with B", "Jumped C", and so).
  - A what-happens-in-the-interact system. So far it is a Hash in game.rb specifying a key that points to an array; the first value specifies the object the key must be combined with, and the second is a Proc of orders that occur if so.

Things that would be great to implement later:
  - NPCs
  - Random encounters
  - Dynamic character stats

Aditional modules (such as turn-oriented events) will come later, once we have a novel we can explore :)
